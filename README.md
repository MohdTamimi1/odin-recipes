Hello Everybody

Can an ubereats driver learn how to Code and secure a job as a web developer

This is the first project through the odin project. It will start with basic html and will grow more with learning more skill

Everytime I change it i will do it through git and push it to github so i keep track of the changes and get used to git more.

Enjoy and will update this once I upload the first video on my youtube channel to share the progress with anyone interested.
